# My name is Tyler Asiyo, and my email address is tylertawo@gmail.com 

# My GitHub account is curently for my CTI-110 class which is an intoduction to web, programming, and database foundations. I intend to grow from this and use it for personal projects in the future.

# The repository I created is going to be used in my class for future projects and files.

# The steps that I took was logging onto GitHub, creating a new repository and cloning it to my desktopso I could access it easily and then finally using VS Studio to edit what is in it. I'm still getting the hang of things but it's cool.
